1) when we want to make new project follow this path 

!!!! Then go in project's setting.py and write the name off app in intalled bar!!!!!!!!

2)Then we have to go on prject urls and write these or edit this 

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path,include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path("",include('app.urls')),
]

3)Then we have to make a urls.py file in app file  and write this

from django.urls import path
from .import views

urlpatterns=[
    path('',views.home),
]

4)then we have to go on views.py and write this 

from django.shortcuts import render

# Create your views here.

def home(req):
    return render(req,'app2/index.html')

5) Now we have to make the folder named templates and app(write the same name as you given to the app) in the app folder.
!!!! like you wirte name of the app is app1 so named the second folder app1 after making  templates folder!!!!

6) Then make a file name index.html in app folder which look like this in templates/app  and write this in index.html


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

1)Now we have to go on Bootstrap and downlad the file from downlad 

2)and then unzip the file  so we get folders of CSS and JS .

3)know we have to make 3 new folder in app folder (which is in static folder) where we have to named them images,js, css

4)copy the 3rd number file in js(from unzip file) which is of 77 kb and paste it in to the app's js folder. name of file will be bootstrap.min.js

5)then copy the  3 rd number file in css (from unzip file) which is of 153kb and paste it in to the app's css folder. name of file will be bootstrap.min.css

6)And know  we have to link these files to index.html by writing this 
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'app2/css/bootstrap.min.css'%}"

7) for bootstrap we have to do this 
<script src="{% static 'app2/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js'%}">


   </script>


8)for images we have to do this 

<img src="{% static 'app2/images/ty.jpg'%}">
